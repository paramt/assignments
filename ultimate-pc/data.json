The processor has an above-average clock speed of 3.8GHz and is even overclockable up to 4.4GHz, although I will not be overclocking it since I don't have sufficient cooling. The processor has 6 cores, which means that the computer will be much better at multitasking and running concurrent tasks . The CPU fits into the AM4 socket on the motherboard.",
